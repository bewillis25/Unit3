Do Now 3.01
#################
1.  In your Console
Type the following code:
    1   import random
    2   random.randint(0, 3)
    3   random.randint(0, 3)
    3   print(random.randint(0, 3))
    4   print(random.randint(0, 3))
    5   print(random.randint(0, 3))
2.  In your Notebook
Respond to the following
    1.  What does randint() do? Gives a random integer for a gievn number range

    2.  What do the values 0 and 3 do? Try changing those numbers, rerun the program, and write down what changed. The numbers 0 and 3 are the limits for the random integers, it can only choose a random integeer from 0 t0 3, or 0,1,2,3. If we change 3 to 4, we will now be able to see 4 in the random function.

    3.  What is the difference between random.randint(0,3) and print(random.randint(0,3))? random.randint(0,3) stores the value as a variable, but print(random.randint(0,3)) prints the value, not storing it as a variable.
